Valentine's Day Sales Analysis on Amazon

In this concise project, I delved into Valentine's Day sales on Amazon to identify popular gifts, dominant brands, highest-rated items, and the overall spending trend.

1. Data Collection Leveraging the 'like' operator, I collected data on Valentine's Day sales, capturing the diversity of gifts available on Amazon.

2. Popular Gifts Utilizing 'round' to round up the figures, I identified the most popular gifts by examining the frequency of purchases. This allowed me to pinpoint the top choices among Amazon customers.

3. Dominant Brand Using the 'having' clause

4. Highest-Rated Items 

5. Total Spending Analysis

This project not only offered a snapshot of Valentine's Day sales but also provided valuable insights into consumer preferences, brand dominance, and the economic impact of this romantic celebration on the Amazon platform ðŸ˜‡
